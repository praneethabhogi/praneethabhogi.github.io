        </p>
        <div class="concept-details">
            <h2>The Concept</h2>
            <p>As someone who had many restrictions and health issues that made it hard to find recipes that met my dietary needs, I envisioned Allerg-Eat as a tool to alleviate the problem. Allerg-Eat is a recipe recommendation system tailored specifically for individuals with food allergies and dietary restrictions.</p>
            <p>My model takes in a user’s allergy information and cravings, which are then used to create a personalized ranked list of recipes. Using fundamental techniques in ML and NLP, Allerg-Eat filters through thousands of recipes to ensure that you can find meals that are both safe and delicious.</p>
            <h3>Data Formatting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Loading Data:</strong> I loaded the raw recipe data from a JSON file using pd.read_json. The data is then transposed to switch rows and columns for proper alignment.</li>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Resetting Index:</strong> I reset the index to have a proper integer-based index and drop the first column which might contain irrelevant data.</li>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Cleaning Ingredients List:</strong> The ingredient_parser function processes each ingredient list to remove stop words, measurement words, accents, and converts them to their base forms for consistency.</li>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Ingredient Parsing:</strong> The function processes each ingredient string by splitting, filtering, and normalizing text, and removes unnecessary words to prepare a clean list of ingredients.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Ingredient Grouping</h3>
            <p>In this step, the ingredients are grouped and processed to understand their semantic relationships.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Grouping Ingredients:</strong> Here, I joined the cleaned ingredient lists into single strings for each recipe. This helps in further processing steps where each recipe is treated as a document for natural language processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I used the Word2Vec model to generate vector representations of the ingredients.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Training Word2Vec:</strong> The Word2Vec model is trained on the cleaned ingredient lists. I used the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) approach to understand the context of each ingredient and create vector representations.</li>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Average Vector Calculation:</strong> This function calculates the average vector representation for each recipe by averaging the vectors of its ingredients.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Similarity Ranking</h3>
            <p>I used cosine similarity to rank the recipes based on user preferences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Cosine Similarity Calculation:</strong> This function calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors to determine how similar they are.</li>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Ranking Function:</strong> This function ranks the recipes based on the user's allergies and cravings. It adjusts the reference vector according to the user's cravings and calculates the cosine similarity for each recipe. The similarity score is then adjusted based on the presence of allergens.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">User Feedback Integration:</strong> Incorporate user feedback to refine the recommendation algorithm and improve the accuracy of the ranked recipes.</li>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Personalized Meal Plans:</strong> Introduce personalized meal plans that consider not just allergies and cravings but also nutritional requirements and dietary goals.</li>
                <li><strong class="red-highlight">Mobile App Development:</strong> Develop a mobile application to make Allerg-Eat accessible on-the-go, providing real-time recipe recommendations based on user location and preferences.</li>

        Carbon Conscious
        <p class="tech-details">
            <em>Database: SQL, MySQL, GCP, BigQuery<br>
            App Development: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Express.js VSCode, Git, Figma</em>
        </p>
        <div class="concept-details">
            <h2>The Concept</h2>
            <p>Over the course of 6 months, my team worked on developing our web application CarbonConscious, aiming to analyze sustainability practices in corporate settings and provide valuable feedback to our users. Our app allows users to input the emissions data for 
                either their specific building or their company as a whole and then are given a comprehensive examination of their environmental contribution. Through the use of graph visuals and interactive elements, CarbonConscious empowers businesses to make informed 
                decisions toward a greener future.</p>
            <h3>Database Organization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We started by creating a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram to map out the relationships between various entities in our data. This was the blueprint for our database schema, allowing us to visualize how the data interacts within our system.</li>
                <li>Relational schema representation:</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hosting the Database</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To host our database, we leveraged the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This provided us with a reliable, scalable, and secure environment for our application. Specifically, we created our own Virtual Machine (VM) on GCP, which allowed us to have full control over the configuration and management of our database. </li>
                <li>We chose MySQL as our database management system due to its robustness and widespread adoption. MySQL's features, such as ACID compliance and support for complex queries, made it an ideal choice for handling our emissions data. By hosting MySQL on a GCP VM, we could easily scale our resources based on demand, ensuring that our application remained performant even as the volume of data grew.</li>
                <li>To set up the tables in MySQL, we used Data Definition Language (DDL) code:</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Planning: Possible Queries and Indexing</h3>
            <p>We wrote four possible advanced queries that could be useful for the purpose of our application:</p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Compare company emission contribution in the same location</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Calculates total emissions for each company within a specific location and determines each company's percentage contribution to the total emissions of that location.</li>
                <li>Helps identify the most significant contributors to emissions within a shared area.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Total Emissions</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Calculates total energy consumption and total emissions for each company by combining data from both company-wide and building-specific records.</li>
                <li>Provides a comprehensive view of each company's overall environmental impact.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Energy Ranking</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Calculates an energy rating for each company by taking into account both negative factors (such as energy consumption and emissions) and positive factors (such as renewable energy usage).</li>
                <li>Ranks companies based on their overall environmental performance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Compare post-feedback</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Compares the total energy consumption and emissions of companies before and after implementing feedback from CarbonConscious.</li>
                <li>Identifies if there has been any reduction in consumption or emissions post-feedback.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In order to enhance the performance of our queries, particularly the post-feedback query, we implemented indexing strategies. This optimization process involved several iterations, where we analyzed the cost impacts of different indexing approaches using the EXPLAIN ANALYZE command.</p>
            <p>A look into MySQL indexing:</p>
            <p>To enhance the functionality and maintainability of our database, we incorporated code for triggers and stored procedures → Automate routine tasks and encapsulate complex queries, leading to better performance and easier management.</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Backend</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Create structure of the application, with stylistic elements to enhance user interaction and experience</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SQL Integration</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrated the total emissions and energy ranking SQL queries into the backend code to interact with our database</li>
